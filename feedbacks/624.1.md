It is bad style to write code that depends on the particular format of
the output from the toString() method, especially if your reason for
doing so is to circumvent the public API (which intentionally does not
provide access to the x- and y-coordinates).

doing so is to circumvent the public API (which intentionally does not
provide access to the x- and y-coordinates).
